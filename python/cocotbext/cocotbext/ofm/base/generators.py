    Idle generator ensures interlacing idle and data transactions in Drivers.

    Idle generators can adopt various behaivour such a "no idles" (full throughput on bus),
    "random idles", "rate limiter", etc.

    This base IdleGenerator generates no idles.

    Driver uses the idle generator by calling pair of .get and .put methods.
    The get method returns a number of idle items, which should be inserted on the bus.
    The put method awaits real number of idle items, which were present on the bus.

    Some idle generators need to know more about the bus parameters and should be parametrized
    with proper configure call.
